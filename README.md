# EXP-examples

These four directories provide some N-body initial conditions, configuration and data files that demonstrate a simulation with EXP.

## Organization

| Directory   | Contents |
| ---         | ---      |
| Binary      | A simulation of binary stars, to learn file formats and syntax |
| DiskHalo    | A tiny simulation of a stellar disk and DM halo that easily can be run on a laptop |
| Nbody       | A larger simulation of a stellar disk and DM halo that requires only modest resources (a business-class or gaming laptop or desktop)  |
| Nbody/data  | Example output files for sanity checking and for some of the pyEXP tutorials |
| SimpleHalo  | A modest spherical halo model with no disk, designed to provide a reference simulation for benchmarking the performance of EXP |

# EXP-examples

These three directories provide a full set of N-body initial conditions and configuration files that demonstrate a simulation with EXP.

## Organization

| Directory   | Contents |
| ---         | ---      |
| Binary      | A simulation of binary stars, to learn file formats and syntax. |
| DiskHaloA   | A tiny simulation of a stellar disk and DM halo that easily can be run on a laptop |
| DiskHaloB   | A larger simulation of a stellar disk and DM halo that requires only modest resources (a business-class or gaming laptop or desktop).  The output from this simulation is used in a number of the pyEXP tutorials. |
| SimpleHalo  | A modest spherical halo model with no disk, designed to provide a reference simulation for benchmarking the performance of EXP |

A more complex example of a disk and halo simulation using higher
resolution adaptive bases.  The cylindrical tables will take much
longer to compute but provide better dynamical fidelity.  The cache
file can be reused for new runs with the same Cylinder parameters.

The EJ* parameters in halo.conf and disk.conf instruct the Component
class to adjust the expansion center to follow the gravitational
potential minumum.  Use the web page documentation for additional
details on these parameters.

Run as follows.  First, change the ldlibdir parameter to point at your
library install directory.  Then, execute the command:

mpirun -np 6 exp -f config.yml

or

mpirun -np 6 exp

assuming that you have a machine with 6 cores.  Note: 'config.yml' is
the default name.  You only need '-f file' for alternate file names.

An EOF cache file is provided, produced in the x86_64 architecture.
This cache file contains a pre-made set of disk basis functions.  It
will be read from the 'outdir' directory.  If you'd like to have a
different outdir from this current working dir, please move the
.eof.cache.run0 to your 'outdir'.

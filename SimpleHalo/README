This is a simple example of using an adaptive spherical basis,
sphereSL.  The model only has one component, a spherical halo.

The target halo model is specified here in the ascii file
SLGridSph.model.  The basis parameters are in the parameters node.
The basis will be computed and tabled on a grid from r in [0.0001,
1.95] with 4000 grid points.  The maximum spherical harmonic order is
l=6 and harmonic has 20 radial basis functions.  The radial interval
is scaled to the interval [-1, 1] with a scale factor r_s=0.0667 using
the scaling function x=(r/r_s - 1)/(r/r_s + 1).  Therefore, r_s should
be chosen to be roughly the scale parameter of the model.  The
parameter self_consistent tells the code to recompute the basis at
every step.  If false, the gravitational field is fixed after the
first evaluation.  Use the web page documentation for additional
details on these parameters.

Run as follows.  First, change the ldlibdir parameter to point at your
library install directory.  Then, execute the command:

mpirun -np 6 exp -f config.yml

or

mpirun -np 6 exp

assuming that you have a machine with 6 cores.  Note: 'config.yml' is
the default name.  You only need '-f file' for alternate file names.

There is a second test config file in this directory: 'fixed.yml'.
This one runs the component in a fixed potential using the 'userhalo'
external potential.
